What are the human and financial implications of immigration detention centers? Data shows that the majority of immigrants detained in Arizona will pass through facilities run by the Corrections Corporation of America. The private prison company relies on federal contracts for 44 percent of its revenue.

One woman, a legal U.S. resident, spent 734 nights at an Eloy, Arizona detention center before being released. The cost to taxpayers: $118/night, a total of $86,612.
